# SpaceX Customer Analysis Report ðŸš€

## Overview
This project analyzes performance data to provide insights into launch trends, mission outcomes, and the impact of customer type on SpaceX's operations.

## Data Sources
- **Launch transactions data** from 2008-2017
- **Kaggle SpaceX 2006- dataset**

## Key Insights
- **Mission Outcomes**: Detailed analysis of mission successes and failures.
- **Launch Sites**: Evaluation of different launch sites and their performance.
- **Customer Type**: Insights into how different types of customers (business vs. government) impact mission outcomes.

## Visualizations
1. **Payload Mass**: A line chart showing the sum of Payload Mass by launch time.
2. **Successful Launches by Location**: A bar chart displaying the success and failure rates of launches performed at different locations.
3. **Mission Outcomes and Customer Type**: A chart displaying successful and failed launches based on customer type.

## Challenges
- **Handling Missing Data**: Imputed missing values using mean imputation.
- **Data Transformation**: Used Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

## Conclusion
This report provides actionable insights into mission outcomes and customer behavior, helping to drive strategic decisions for SpaceX.

## Project Details
### Failure Rates
