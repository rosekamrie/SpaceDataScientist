# Hypothesis Testing: SpaceX Launch Success Rates

## Hypotheses
- **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: There is no difference in the success rates between business and government launches.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\))**: There is a difference in the success rates between business and government launches.

## Method
A t-test was conducted to compare the success rates of business and government launches.

## Data
- **Business Success Rates**: [0.92, 0.85, 0.89, ...]
- **Government Success Rates**: [0.75, 0.78, 0.80, ...]

## Results
```python
import scipy.stats as stats

business_success_rates = [0.92, 0.85, 0.89, ...]
government_success_rates = [0.75, 0.78, 0.80, ...]

t_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(business_success_rates, government_success_rates)

print(f"T-statistic: {t_statistic}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value}")
